I've been around as much as a metaphor\
But I've never seen your face before\
Yes, you're a stranger in my eyes\
Though I know I should recognise you

You ask me how my day has been\
Just like you are my brethren\
But I don't know what I can say\
Except I have to go on my way

When I saw you yesterday\
Spreading toast with marmalade\
I didn't know it'd be the last\
I didn't know it'd soon be in the past

There are at least a thousand ways a person can look\
And you don't look like any of 'em\
No you don't look like any of 'em

> This is where it goes somewhere weird. I don't think this is the right direction but I think it's kind of funny:

Well, I'm glad that the facial reconstruction surgery went fine\
But I wish just a little bit that maybe we could've had more time
