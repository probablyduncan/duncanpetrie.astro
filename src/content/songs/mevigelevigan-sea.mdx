> This is _definitely_ unfinished.

When I think of all the oceans all the places I could be\
There won't ever be another like the mevigelevigan sea

When I was naught but twenty left for oceans deep and cold\
But nowhere ever equaled to the memory of home

And the shallow watered halcyon was always on my mind

And the wind was like a river and the clouds were like a boat\
And the birds were wheeling whimsical as lazy as they float\
Where the water's deep cerulian the waves are [sic.]

...something something in my tomb,\
Sweeping cyclical and frantic like a mouse around the room
