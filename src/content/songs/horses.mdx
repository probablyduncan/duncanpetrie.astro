> I wrote this when I was walking in the woods on a hot summer day. I didn't make the connection at the time, but I think this is related to the fact that I'd just seen Barbie.

It is a necessary complication\
I don't mind the agitation\
Some things they just need a little time

Cause when you're sitting next to me\
Well I should be in ecstasy\
But there's one thing I can't get off my mind

You see I feel a little hesitation\
Matrimony trepidation\
A door of mine is closing, this is true

Before we up and tie the knot\
And settle down and have our lot\
There's one thing that this man's gotta do

I just wanna ride horses\
I just wanna ride horses

I wanna saddle up a restless mare\
I wanna run my fingers through her hair\
I wanna ride and ride until the sun is low

I don't know how to make you understand\
That this is not a total change of plan\
I just feel a little caught in your lasso

I'm not trying here to rile you up\
Just trying to say giddy up\
What will it take for you to get the gist?

It's not drama I want to stir up\
It's just I want my foot in a stirrup\
And to cross this thing right off my bucket list

\* interlude \*\
\* transition to sadder music \*

I saw a program on tv\
It was horses, strong and free\
It made me think: oh what could be!\
But I have a fianc√©

Oh I could be equestrian\
I'd ride into the west and then\
I'd be among the best of men\
But fate, it seems to taunt: neigh!!

I just wanna ride horses!\
I just wanna ride horses!

Before we go the bridal way\
I want to ride down a bridleway\
Oh, can't you see, babe, that I have a need

If I could ride a country mile\
Before you walk on down the aisle\
Just me and my old purebred mountain steed

Yeah I wanna ride horses\
I just wanna ride horses
