I's heading back home bout quarter to nine\
In an alley so dim I's walking blind\
Heard a funny little thing coming up behind\
Put real big worry in the back of my mind

Was a cat in the alley with an overcoat\
Little mean little eyes through cigar smoke\
Had claws in his paws and they gamme a poke\
He said how's bout you take a ride on my boat

He said I just want to be a little\
Ship cat eatin ship rats\
On the high seas in a fine breeze\
Where to go up in the crows nest\
For a catnap lookin out west\
Is the only escape that I'd need

He said I just want to stalk a little\
Rodent down below decks\
Tween a bulkhead and a crew bed\
Or to see in the fold of a sail\
Little twitch twitch of a pink tail\
Is the biggest thrill that I'd ever need

He said I just want to feel\
The churn of the ocean\
Where a vermin devotion\
Is the only life to lead

He just wants to be a cat \
On a ship on the seas\
But he's stuck on the land\
He's a lubber it seems

Now he found him a boat\
He's as close as can be\
All he needs is a captain\
That's what he's asking me
