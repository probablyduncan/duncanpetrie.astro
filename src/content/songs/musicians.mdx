The musicians of a family of instruments played\
with the grace of a breath of fresh air

As the columns and arches of old town\
danced in the deafening dust of warfare

The chimes in the wind were a chorus of\
swords, a mosaic of blood and hot spit

But the strings in the alley kept singing,\
down with the city like down with the ship
