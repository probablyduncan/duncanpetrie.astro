> I wanted to write a blues song. I'm not sure how to follow this verse, though.

Uphill pissin, and I ain't got no shoes\
I can feel it running warm down between my toes\
I been here many times before got nothing to lose\
Yeah I'm uphill pissin singing flash flood blues

> Also this line:

Take a long walk up a short hill, that's a switchback ruse
