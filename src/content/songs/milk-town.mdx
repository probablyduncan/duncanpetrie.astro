I got a one way ticket to old milk town\
I got a big old bucket of bones right now

I'm gonna find a patch of unpicked ground\
I'm gonna stake my claim in old milk town

I'm gonna plant those bones a ten feet down\
I'm gonna watch them grow into a cow

And then a when my bones become bovine\
And all the stars up high have been aligned

And yes and when my bones have come alive\
I'm gonna make my fortune of milk so fine
