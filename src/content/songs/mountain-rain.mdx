> I came up with this when I was walking in the [Lake District](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BErmutFpAgYHtHef7). It should be longer but now that I'm down from the fells I can't seem to add to it.

Sometimes I get the feeling\
I should go up to the mountain\
And look out across the valley when it rains

And see all the little droplets\
And the people in the village\
As they duck into the doorways as it rains
