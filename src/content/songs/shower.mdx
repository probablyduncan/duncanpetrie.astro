> This is a song from the early pandemic. Maybe it reflects that somehow, I'm not sure.

There's a spider in my bathroom in the corner of my shower\
And I don't know where she came from, what she's doing at this hour\
Her web is spare, hexagonal, but dotted with no flies\
And she's pacing back and forth, her pincers primed to paralyze

There's a spider in my bathroom in the corner of the shower\
And she sits there all alone atop her silky ivory tower\
I can't turn on the water now, I'd wash her home away\
Guess I don't need to shower now, tomorrow's another day...

I've been showerless for thirty days, the flies are closing in!\
They've made a home up in my hair, the future's looking grim!\
That spider still won't move, please contact my next of kin,\
I haven't cleaned behind my ears in weeks,\
I've given up my head like Anne Boleyn

I didn't know they lived that long!\
I didn't know they lived that long!\
When will that spider die?\
When will that spider die?

\* musical interlude \*

Now I've left that house behind, the wait is done, the spider's won\
I took an amtrak cross the country, didn't sit next to anyone

I had a car all to myself, my stench drove them all to go\
And I landed on the riverbank outside of Buffalo

I built a house next to niagara let the spray weigh down my hair\
I don't know if that spider's gone and frankly I don't care

But I'm happy, now, or\
At the very least I'm clean\
Under this permanent shower\
Life can be a dream
