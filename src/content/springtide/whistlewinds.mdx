The Whistlewinds are a low, scrappy range of mountains separating [Dylund]() from [Drumlind](). They stretch south from the [Wide North Woods]() to the [Wencewood](). They are exposed and sharp, cut with steep gorges and thin, bent birch groves. For a very long time they were home to the [Zigglewomp](zigglewomping).
