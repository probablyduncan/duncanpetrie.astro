The Sands of Khomik are a dry and fine-grained place. They are to the south of [Tenehuat](), on the northwest shore of the [Middle Sea](), and they only exist for a bad pun.

The only town of any significance there is a port called [Wheezle](). They mostly trade in eels, there. The émigré neighborhood in Daybreak, [Big Wheezle](daybreak#), has a larger population.
