{/* Duncan Petrie is a London-based photographer and writer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He explores nature in the human landscape, and what the world might look like when we are gone. He holds a 1st class degree in Marine and Natural History Photography from Falmouth University. */}

I'm a photographer, writer, and web developer from Milwaukee, based in London.

In 2022, I graduated from Falmouth University in Cornwall with a 1st class degree in [Marine & Natural History Photography](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/marine-natural-history-photography). Ever since, I've been a full time .NET developer (weird pivot, I know). In my free time, I'm taking pictures, writing, and building passion projects like this website.

## Photography

Much of my work explores the _Yearning_, a kind of nostalgia, felt at the edges of things, for lives or worlds that don't or can't exist. Fleeting details in the landscape—the tail of a whale rising out of the sea, or familiar music from a window passed at night—act like glimpses into little worlds.

These worlds we find in the cracks of our own are implied and imagined, no more real than a bedtime story, and yet they are far more emotionally true, pull far stronger on the strings of our heart, than actual fact. Their potency is their unknowability; reality would only disappoint.

I explore these timeless and littoral worlds extensively in my photobook, [Lingermyth](/lingermyth), and my undergraduate dissertation, [On Yearning](/on-yearning).

## Writing

I've been building a world, called [Springtide](), for a long time. There are some stories, some songs, and some entries in a wiki that nobody besides me would find interesting. It's a sort of happy place, a collection of all the places, landscapes, art and writing I've ever loved.

## Code

In 2019, after one look at the price of Squarespace, I decided to make my own website, from scratch. Every year or so, I get antsy, and end up remaking it entirely. This is a problem. Too much time working on the website, not enough time making things to put on it. But it's also fun. Having a website is like having a bedroom: eventually, it gets old and you want to redectorate.

I built this iteration ([github](https://github.com/probablyduncan/duncanpetrie.astro)) in summer 2024 using [Astro.build](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/). The last version ([live site](https://duncanpetrie.vercel.app/), [github](https://github.com/probablyduncan/duncanpetrie.nextjs)), built in early 2023, was a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) app. Before that, my website was vanilla html/css/js ([live site](https://probablyduncan.github.io/), [github](https://github.com/probablyduncan/probablyduncan.github.io)).
