_To Pigeon-Fill the Sky_ is a 100-page photobook about birds, the artistic process, and AI. It is available in [A4 (large)](https://mixam.co.uk/print-on-demand/66e6e09c857460690c7cf88d) or [A5 (small)](https://mixam.co.uk/print-on-demand/66ed8855c1ca05428611a44b) sizes.

Returning to photography after a year-long hiatus, I felt that my new images were weak. They lacked dynamism, punctum, decisive moments. No birds filled their skies. I had spent a year remembering the best of my old images, rose-tinted, and had forgotten the patience and persistence that was required to make them. I had forgotten that good art takes hard work.

I thought about the recent prevalence of AI 'art', and imagined an artist who might forego that patience, persistence, and hard work for an artificially injected decisive moment. I built _To Pigeon-Fill the Sky_ around that idea.
