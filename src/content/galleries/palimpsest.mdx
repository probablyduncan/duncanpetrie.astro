_Palimpsest is a portfolio and still-in-progress photobook of images taken between the summers of 2023 and 2024, predominently in London and the southeast of England._

In 1989, Francis Fukuyama declared that humanity had reached the "[End of History](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~bslantchev/courses/pdf/Fukuyama%20-%20End%20of%20History.pdf)". The Cold War had been won. Liberal democracy had prevailed. But there is another End of History, one that becomes more clear every day.

Our ecosystems are rocketing towards collapse. Our forests burn. Our oceans acidify. Extinctions happen daily, as our blood fills with plastic. If we do not act fast, there will be no one left to record our history. The world will overwrite us.

My photographic work is built around glimpses. In exploring our present landscape, I search for evocations of other time. A dragon's tail where the TV bumped the wall. Constellations in curtains, hand-blown glass. Ancient actors' footprints in the dust of vacant stages.

For years, I thought I was capturing the past. A [lingering world of myth](/lingermyth), beneath our own, like a first coat of paint. Echoes of old in the scracks of the new. I realized recently that what I am actually capturing is the future. Glimpses not of the prehistoric, but the posthistoric. Just as we have written over our past, so too will the future write over us.

Palimpsest is a project that explores nature in the human landscape, and asks a simple question: What will our world look like, when we are gone?
